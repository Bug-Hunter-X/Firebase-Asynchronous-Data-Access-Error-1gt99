The following Firebase code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to asynchronous operations and data consistency:

```javascript
//Attempting to access data from a Firebase query before it's fully resolved
db.ref('users').orderByChild('score').once('value', function(snapshot) {
  const highestScore = snapshot.val()[Object.keys(snapshot.val())[0]].score;
  console.log('Highest Score:', highestScore); //This might log undefined
});

//Subsequent code that depends on highestScore
console.log('Processing Highest Score:', highestScore); //highestScore is not available here
```

This code often leads to unexpected behavior because `once('value')` is asynchronous. The second `console.log` executes *before* the Firebase query completes, resulting in `highestScore` being undefined.
